    "Remember that you calculated that the beta lyrae transit was long -- a couple days. For other eclipsing binaries that you might discover, the transit might just be a few hours. Still, you only have 1.5 hours to observe a few hour transit (or in the case of beta lyrae, a few day transit). There are a couple ways you can go about this:\n",

    "* Schedule several observations during the transit, like we discussed in the prelab. So you might schedule a 10 minute block of observations right at egress. Another 10 minute block 4 hours later, and so forth. Then schedule a few of these blocks during the minimum of the transit. I'm going to call this method \"sparse sampling\" of the transit. However, as you found above, do not schedule single observations. Overhead will quickly eat up your telescope time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shorter orbital periods help, because the transits are faster. Algol is not visible currently from any LCO telescopes. It is too close to the sun. However, if you wanted to observe a star like Algol, that just has a few hour transit, then you could do sparse sampling like above. OR you could coordinate with another group and pool your time. With two groups, you could just schedule a single 3 hour block (or two consecutive 1.5 hour blocks) that cover the entire transit of an Algol-like star. That would produce a beautiful data set!\n",

E.g., use the general catalog of variable stars on vizier, and restrict RA to be less than 4 hours and greater than 10 hours -- this will give you everything that is NOT behind the sun. These sources are most likely visible from one of LCO's many observation sites.\n",
